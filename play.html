    <h3> THE DIABOLICAL CIRCLE by Beulah Bornstead</h3>
    <p>
        ADONIJAH. [_Brimming over with self-satisfaction._] That have I ever
sought to be.
<br>
COTTON. An example that others would do well to imitate.
<br>
ADONIJAH. [_All puffed up._] Nay, others value it not. They be envious
of my good fortune.
<br>
COTTON. A most prudent young man! Nay, be not so over-blushingly timid.
Thou'rt too modest.
<br>
ADONIJAH. [_His face falling._] But Betty--doth she regard me thus?
<br>
COTTON. The ways of a maid are past finding out; but despair not. I
think she hath thee much to heart, but, as the perverse heart of woman
dictateth, behaveth much to the contrary.
<br>
ADONIJAH. [_Brightening up as one with new hopes._] Thou thinkest----
<br>
COTTON. [_Interrupting._] Nay, lad, I am sure of it. Betty was ever a
dutiful daughter.
<br>
     [_All unseen_, BETTY _peeks out mischievously_.
     <br>
ADONIJAH. But I mistrust me her heart is elsewhere.
<br>
COTTON. Thou referr'st to young Manning without doubt. It can never be.
'Tis but a passing fancy.
<br>
ADONIJAH. Nay, but I fear Charles thinketh not so. I have been told in
secret [_leaning forward confidentially_] by one that hath every
opportunity to know, that he hath enjoined Goodman Shrewsbury to send
for--[_impressively_] a ring!
<br>
COTTON. [_Angered._] A ring, sayest thou?
<br>
ADONIJAH. [_Nodding._] Aye, even so.
<br>
COTTON. But he hath not signified such intention here to me.
<br>
ADONIJAH. Then there are no grounds for his rash presumption?
